# Specification Quality Checklist: Console Todo CRUD Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-27
**Feature**: [specs/001-console-todo-crud/spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | Spec focuses on WHAT users need, not HOW to implement |
| Requirements | PASS | 15 functional requirements, all testable |
| User Stories | PASS | 6 stories with priorities (4 P1, 2 P2) |
| Success Criteria | PASS | 9 measurable outcomes, all user-focused |
| Edge Cases | PASS | 7 edge cases identified |
| Scope | PASS | Clear boundaries with Out of Scope section |

## Summary

**Status**: READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase. All quality criteria have been met:
- 6 user stories covering all 5 basic features + navigation
- 15 functional requirements with MUST language
- 9 measurable success criteria
- Clear assumptions and out-of-scope items documented

## Next Steps

1. Run `/sp.plan` to create technical implementation plan
2. Run `/sp.tasks` to break down into executable tasks
3. Use `python-console-agent` for implementation
